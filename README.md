# BongoBolt Challenge Tracker

## Overview

This website is designed to track and display the performance of players in GeoGuessr-like challenges set on private chats. It serves as a comprehensive speedrun table, offering a simple yet informative interface for challenge participants and spectators alike.

## Features

- **Speedrun Table**: Displays player times for completing challenges.
- **Challenge Details**:
  - Links to original challenge images
  - Guessed locations with verification status
  - Completion times (from image posting to challenge completion)
  - Challenge dates
  - Applicable rule versions at the time of completion
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy to navigate and understand for all users.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to create a centralized platform for GeoGuessr enthusiasts to:
1. Track their performance over time
2. Compare their results with other players
3. Access historical challenge data and rule sets

## How It Works

1. Challenges are posted with accompanying images.
2. Players attempt to identify the location as quickly as possible.
3. Upon completion, players submit their guesses along with proof (e.g., Google Maps link).
4. The system records the time taken, verifies the submission, and updates the leaderboard.
5. All attempts, including unsuccessful ones, are recorded for transparency.

## Rules

Rules v1.0
- Challenge images can be posted at any time but must be accompanied by a challenge message.
- Timing starts when the challenge message is posted and ends when proof is submitted (preferably a Google Maps link).
- All attempts, including unsuccessful ones, remain visible to encourage accuracy.
- Submissions must include verifiable evidence (e.g., map link, screenshot, or equivalent).
- Participants may use any resources or tools to solve the challenge - no restrictions apply.
